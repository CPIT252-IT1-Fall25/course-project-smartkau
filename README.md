# Project Name: 
Smart Study Task Manager

## Description of the Problem
Students often struggle to manage different academic tasks such as assignments, exams, and personal study activities. Traditional to-do list applications treat all tasks the same and do not consider differences in priority, deadlines, or task type. This makes it difficult for students to organize their study workload effectively.
The goal of this project is to develop a Smart Study Task Manager that helps students manage and organize their academic tasks more efficiently by categorizing tasks based on their type and deadlines.
